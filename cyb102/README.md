# CYB102 – Intermediate Cybersecurity (CodePath, Summer 2025)

This folder contains my personal notes for **CYB102: Intermediate Cybersecurity**, a hands-on Blue Team course offered by CodePath during Summer 2025.

---

## 🧠 Course Focus

CYB102 focuses on real-world defensive cybersecurity practices, including:

- Log analysis and network traffic inspection
- Host and endpoint intrusion detection
- DoS attack mitigation and SIEM exploration
- Incident response workflows
- Threat intelligence and hunting techniques

## 📁 What's in This Folder

Each week has its own folder (e.g., `week-1`, `week-2`, etc.), which contains:

- `notes.md`: My lecture notes, reflections, and summaries

If I later decide to include projects or labs, I’ll add them gradually and redact any sensitive details where needed.

---

## 🧭 Future Additions (Maybe)

- ✅ Weekly project summaries (only if public-safe)
- ✅ Lab write-ups or tool usage tips
- ✅ Capstone insights (team-safe version)
