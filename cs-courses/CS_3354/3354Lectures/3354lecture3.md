## **What we covered in the first hour**

---

This lecture covered software development process models with a focus on requirements engineering. The discussion examined different approaches to software development and the critical importance of proper requirements gathering.

### Software Process Models Review

- Prototype model is useful when stakeholders lack understanding of requirements
- Traditional waterfall approach requires 2-3 years of development before delivery, making it difficult to pivot
- Agile methodology better handles frequent requirement changes
- Test-driven development creates actionable tests for user stories
- Continuous testing ensures changes don't break existing functionality

### Requirements Engineering Fundamentals

- Requirements serve as communication between all stakeholders (users, customers, managers, developers)
- Early focus on requirements is crucial as errors become exponentially more expensive to fix later
- Requirements engineering process involves: elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation
- Large projects (like NASA's rover) can require hundreds of thousands of pages of specifications
- Requirements should be detailed, actionable, and have clear input-to-output mappings

### Types of Requirements

- Functional requirements: specify what the system should do (features, capabilities)
- Non-functional requirements: performance aspects including response time, reliability, portability
- Process constraints: restrictions placed on development
- Design constraints: limitations affecting design decisions

### Challenges in Requirements Gathering

- Language barriers between technical and business stakeholders
- Stakeholders often have poor understanding of system capabilities
- Software engineers may lack domain knowledge
- Requirements need to be well-defined, not vague ("user-friendly" is too ambiguous)

### Requirements Elicitation Techniques

- Brainstorming: generate many ideas prioritizing quantity over quality
- Interviews: structured approaches with prepared scripts but flexibility for follow-up
- Prototyping: building simple versions to clarify and validate requirements

## **What we covered in the second hour**

---

This lecture covers various approaches to requirements elicitation, analysis, and the beginning of specification in software engineering.

### Requirements Gathering Approaches

**Ethnography (Observation)**

- Pros: Uses natural language specification
- Cons:
  - Time-consuming to identify actual requirements
  - Difficult to validate user pain points
  - May involve private/illegal information
  - Limited to present observations
  - User needs change over time (e.g., junior vs senior developers)
  - Typically used with existing systems

**Prototype/Strawman Approach**

- Create prototype software to show stakeholders and collect feedback
- Can use GUI mockups, webpages, or flowcharts to convey ideas without coding
- Pros:
  - Provides detailed insight into potential issues
  - Example-based, resulting in accurate requirements
- Cons:
  - Creating prototypes can be costly
  - Requires preliminary knowledge of desired features
  - Pre-assumptions may limit software scope

### Requirements Analysis

- Analyze and prioritize requirements from different stakeholders' perspectives
- Business analysts bridge the gap between stakeholders and development teams
- Helps resolve conflicting views between different stakeholders
- Enables creation of actionable user stories
- Different stakeholders (faculty vs students) have different perspectives on requirements

### Specification and Validation

- After analysis, create formal specifications (e.g., UML diagrams)
- Use formal specification languages
- Requirements evolve over time (tracked with version numbers)
- Automated validation tools exist but require proper specification
- Full specification and validation will be covered in the next class

### Application

- Students should apply these concepts to their course projects
- Consider which requirement gathering techniques work best for specific projects
- A combination of approaches is typically used in practice (interviews, brainstorming, prototypes)
