# Assignment 01 – Good and Bad Design

**Due: 06/08/25**

## Article 1 – “Human Factors in Interactive Systems” by Ben Shneiderman

One point I strongly agree with is Shneiderman’s emphasis on **"control and closure."** As someone who has used countless apps, I can say from direct experience that nothing feels worse than being forced through a series of rigid instructions just to use something. The best-designed apps I’ve used are the ones that make me feel like I’m discovering things naturally—not being bossed around by a machine.

For example, when I first tried the Zed text editor, there were no pop-ups, no tutorials, and no setup hoops. It launched instantly and felt intuitive from the start. I could explore at my own pace and slowly uncover features on my own, which made me more invested in using it. That sense of control—combined with a smooth, non-intrusive experience—made it feel powerful and respectful. In contrast, apps that try to “hand-hold” too much often make me feel patronized and frustrated.

This idea of control is fundamental in good design. When users feel like they’re in charge, they’re more confident, more willing to explore, and more likely to stick with the product long-term. I believe many developers overcorrect and end up designing systems that restrict rather than empower.

## Article 2 – “Challenges of HCI Design and Implementation” by Brad A. Myers

For the second article by Brad A. Myers, I also agree with the point that **HCI must become a core part of CS education**—and honestly, I think it should be a core part of almost any user-centric field. We live in a world built on consumership, and we’re constantly creating systems and tools meant to improve people’s lives. But way too often, the tools we make aren’t intuitive at all.

From restaurants to entertainment to finance—everything people use and interact with could be made so much easier to understand. We just need to stay mindful of how we're setting things up for our users to feel confident and navigate those tools with ease and grace. That’s what makes people feel capable and curious.

And I think the same should be true for education. If schools, classes, and academic programs collaborated more with HCI professionals, I truly believe more people would be able to learn even the most difficult concepts—just because of how we present and design the content. This is where I see the future of education heading.
