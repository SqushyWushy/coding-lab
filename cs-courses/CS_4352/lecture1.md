## **Introduction to HCI Video**

---

This session covered the foundational concepts of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and User Experience (UX) from Module 1 of a course. The presentation explored the interdisciplinary nature of HCI, the User-Centered Design approach, and the differences between UI and UX.

### What is HCI?

- An interdisciplinary field drawing from computer science, psychology, and design
- Defined as "the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive systems for human use"
- Focuses on User-Centered Design (UCD) approach
- Involves understanding how humans form mental models when interacting with computer systems

### UI vs UX Distinction

- User Interface (UI): The space where interactions between humans and machines occur
- User Experience (UX): The process of creating products that provide meaningful experiences
- Illustrated through examples:
  - Ketchup bottle comparison (glass bottle as UI vs. squeezy bottle as UX)
  - Footpath design vs. actual user behavior showing the difference between designed intent and real usage

### The UX Lifecycle

- Three main phases: design, prototype, and evaluation
- Begins with understanding user needs, goals, tasks, and context
- Involves creating prototypes using tools like Figma and [Proto.io](http://proto.io/)
- Requires evaluation through heuristics or user testing
- Based on iteration to close gaps between user needs and final design

### Career Opportunities

- Interaction engineers/designers
- User experience researchers
- Product managers
- Information architects
- Usability specialists

### Importance of User-Centered Design

- Computing systems are ubiquitous in daily life
- Poor interface design leads to poor user adoption
- Design failures are the designer's responsibility, not the user's
- Good HCI combines effective UI and UX principles

## **Good and Bad Design Video**

---

This lecture introduces the concept of good and bad design, based on principles from Don Norman's book "The Design of Everyday Things." The presentation covers why users shouldn't need hours to figure out how to use well-designed products.

### Examples of Good vs. Bad Design

- **Elevator controls**: Good design makes buttons visually distinct, while bad design makes them all look the same, leading to user errors
- **Vending machines**: Bad design requires users to push a button before inserting money, contradicting common conventions
- **Measuring cups**: Traditional designs force awkward viewing angles; improved designs allow reading measurements from the top
- **Doors**: Good door design makes it obvious how to operate them without frustration or ambiguity
- **Stove controls**: Poor designs have arbitrary arrangements of burner controls; better designs clearly map controls to their corresponding burners

### Key Design Principles

- Users often blame themselves for errors, when poor design is actually at fault
- Designers should anticipate potential errors and design to minimize them
- Errors should be easily reversible when they do occur
- HCI professionals should be involved early in the design process, not just during testing
- Accessibility is crucial‚Äîinterfaces should accommodate elderly and disabled users

### Learning Activity

- Exercise: Sketch two different doors and evaluate them for good and bad design principles
- Additional resource: "Bad Doors" video in the week's materials

## **[It's not you. Bad doors are everywhere.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI)**

---

The discussion explores the concept of "Norman doors" - poorly designed doors that confuse users about whether to push or pull them, named after design expert Don Norman.

### The Problem with Bad Doors

The conversation begins with frustrations about a confusing door at the Vox Media office. Participants share experiences of regularly witnessing people misusing doors because of poor design signals. These problematic designs require explicit instructions (like "push" or "pull" signs) to compensate for their unintuitive nature.

### Don Norman's Design Philosophy

Don Norman, described as the author of "the essential book about design," explains that he was inspired to write his book after struggling with everyday objects like light switches, water taps, and doors while in England. He emphasizes that when people consistently misuse an object, it's a sign of bad design, not user error.

### Key Design Principles

Norman outlines two fundamental design principles:

- **Discoverability**: Users should be able to discover what operations are possible just by looking at an object
- **Feedback**: Users should receive clear information about what happened after an interaction

These principles form the foundation of human-centered design, an approach that prioritizes people's actual needs and behaviors.

### Human-Centered Design Process

The iterative design process involves:

1. Observing people using current products/services
2. Generating ideas based on these observations
3. Prototyping potential solutions
4. Testing the prototypes with real users
5. Refining based on feedback

This process has applications beyond doors, improving everything from everyday objects to public health solutions in developing countries.

### Better Door Design Solutions

Examples of human-centered door designs include:

- Flat plates that can only be pushed
- Push bars with pieces sticking out on one side to indicate the pushing direction

Despite these solutions, poorly designed doors persist because they're rarely a deciding factor in larger purchases (like houses) and aren't typically regulated except for safety reasons.

### The Case for Good Design

The transcript concludes with a call to apply human-centered design principles more broadly to create a better-designed world that serves people's actual needs rather than forcing people to adapt to poor design.

## **‚ÄúHuman Factors in Interactive Systems‚Äù by Ben Shneiderman**

---

### üîç Purpose of the Article

To highlight the importance of human factors and experimental design in building user-friendly interactive computer systems, contrasting it with ad hoc or intuition-driven design approaches.

### üß† Core Ideas

1. Design Is a Balancing Act
   Interactive systems must balance simplicity vs. power, ease of use vs. flexibility, and freedom vs. error prevention‚Äîwith no universal algorithm for success.

2. Know the User
   The first principle of user-centered design is: ‚ÄúKnow the user.‚Äù
   Systems should minimize memorization, handle errors gracefully, and feel predictable and supportive.

3. User Attitudes and Anxiety Matter
   Negative attitudes and fear of failure worsen performance. Systems should reduce stress by being intuitive, encouraging, and non-punitive.

4. Control and Closure
   Users want to feel in control, not bossed around by the machine.
   Tasks should offer clear endpoints to give users a sense of completion (closure).

5. Response Time
   ‚Ä¢ Users prefer consistent response times over fast but unpredictable ones.
   ‚Ä¢ Different tasks tolerate different wait times (e.g., loading files vs. editing).

6. Batch vs. Time-Sharing Systems
   ‚Ä¢ Time-sharing (interactive systems) often boosts decision-making and satisfaction.
   ‚Ä¢ However, some users perform better with batch systems, depending on personality traits like assertiveness or locus of control. 7.

### Text Editing and Habits

‚Ä¢ Novices prefer simpler editors; experienced users benefit from flexibility.
‚Ä¢ Usage habits are hard to break‚Äîeven when new features are introduced. 8. Error Handling
‚Ä¢ Errors should be caught early, with clear, respectful messages.
‚Ä¢ Allow users to correct errors without redoing everything.

### ‚úÖ Best Practices for Designers

‚Ä¢ Design for short-term memory limits

‚Ä¢ Break tasks into modular chunks

‚Ä¢ Avoid condescending feedback

‚Ä¢ Respect user preferences and personalities

‚Ä¢ Build thoughtful error messages and provide help-on-demand

## **‚ÄúChallenges of HCI Design and Implementation‚Äù by Brad A. Myers**

---

### üß† Main Idea

Designing and implementing Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) is inherently difficult and will remain so. This article explains why usability is crucial and why creating good interfaces is so challenging‚Äîboth in design and technical implementation.

### üí° Why User Interfaces Matter

    ‚Ä¢	Usability is critical to the success of consumer devices and commercial software.
    ‚Ä¢	Users expect tools to be easy and intuitive, and they don‚Äôt want to read manuals.
    ‚Ä¢	Studies show usability:
    ‚Ä¢	Increases productivity
    ‚Ä¢	Reduces costs and support needs
    ‚Ä¢	Can save millions (e.g., NYNEX saved $2M/year by skipping a poorly designed system)
    ‚Ä¢	Poor interfaces have led to disasters, like the Therac-25 radiation deaths and military misfires.

### üöß Why HCI Design Is So Difficult

1. Knowing Users Is Hard
   ‚Ä¢ Users often don‚Äôt know what they want.
   ‚Ä¢ Designers can‚Äôt unlearn their own knowledge (‚Äúcurse of expertise‚Äù).
   ‚Ä¢ Systems serve diverse user types, so one-size-fits-all doesn‚Äôt work.

2. Tasks Are Inherently Complex
   ‚Ä¢ Modern software (e.g., MS Word, AutoCAD) has hundreds of features.
   ‚Ä¢ Even helpful metaphors (like ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù) can create new confusion.

3. Many Competing Requirements
   ‚Ä¢ UI design must juggle:
   ‚Ä¢ Standards
   ‚Ä¢ Graphic design
   ‚Ä¢ Documentation
   ‚Ä¢ Performance
   ‚Ä¢ Internationalization
   ‚Ä¢ Social/political context
   ‚Ä¢ Legal concerns
   ‚Ä¢ Time & cost constraints

4. No Silver Bullet
   ‚Ä¢ There is no universal method or tool that makes UI design easy.
   ‚Ä¢ Guidelines often conflict or fail to generalize.
   ‚Ä¢ Great design remains a creative, human-driven process‚Äîlike art or architecture.

5. Iterative Design Is Necessary but Hard
   ‚Ä¢ Testing with users is expensive and slow.
   ‚Ä¢ Real users may be unavailable or behave unnaturally in tests.
   ‚Ä¢ Fixing one usability issue can create new ones.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Why HCI Implementation Is Technically Hard

1. Consumes Over Half of Dev Time
   ‚Ä¢ UI often takes 50% or more of code, testing, and maintenance.

2. Event-Driven & Reactive
   ‚Ä¢ Must react to user input in real-time.
   ‚Ä¢ Requires multiprocessing, robust error handling, and abort/undo mechanisms.

3. Real-Time Constraints
   ‚Ä¢ Feedback must happen in under 16ms to feel smooth.
   ‚Ä¢ Multimedia (speech, video) increases this pressure.

4. Poor Language Support
   ‚Ä¢ Most programming languages lack built-in support for GUI programming.
   ‚Ä¢ Toolkits (like Mac ToolBox or Motif) are complex and inconsistent.

5. Hard to Test
   ‚Ä¢ Automated testing tools often don‚Äôt work for GUIs.
   ‚Ä¢ Visual outputs change, buttons move, making regression testing brittle.

6. Difficult to Modularize
   ‚Ä¢ UI and business logic are often tightly coupled.
   ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCallback hell‚Äù from event-driven design increases maintenance costs.

### ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

For Developers:
‚Ä¢ Use trained HCI specialists and cross-functional teams (designers, writers, developers).
‚Ä¢ Iterate, test with real users, and use high-level tools like interface builders and prototyping platforms.

For Educators:
‚Ä¢ HCI must become a core part of CS education, not an optional skill.

For Researchers:
‚Ä¢ Focus on better tools, testable models, new interaction styles, and domain-specific interfaces.
