CS 4352 Human-Computer Interaction I (3 semester credit hours) Broad overview of how human-computer interaction (HCI) informs the user-centered design (UCD) process. Practical experience in the core methods of user experience design and research throughout the product development cycle.
CS 4352: Human-Computer Interaction I is a user experience (UX) and design thinking class — the complete opposite vibe of systems programming. Instead of talking to machines, this class teaches you to design systems that talk to humans.

⸻

1. HCI Principles
   • Understand how humans interact with technology
   • Learn about cognitive load, perception, mental models
   • Why certain designs are intuitive and others are frustrating

⸻

2. User-Centered Design (UCD)

Design with the user’s needs, goals, and pain points in mind

    •	The UCD cycle:
    1.	Observe the user
    2.	Understand the problem
    3.	Design solutions
    4.	Prototype
    5.	Test & improve

⸻

3. UX Research Methods
   • Interviews, surveys, observation
   • Personas: fictional user profiles that represent your audience
   • Journey maps: chart the user’s steps, feelings, pain points

⸻

4. Prototyping
   • You probably used Figma, Sketch, or pen-and-paper wireframes
   • Lo-fi prototypes for early testing
   • Hi-fi mockups for more realistic interaction

⸻

5. Usability Testing
   • Test your designs with real users
   • Track usability metrics (like time to complete a task, error rates)
   • Learn how to iterate based on feedback

⸻

6. Accessibility & Inclusive Design
   • Designing for users with disabilities (visual, motor, cognitive)
   • Follow WCAG guidelines (e.g., contrast ratios, keyboard nav)
   • Tools like screen readers and ARIA roles

⸻

7. Human Factors & Cognitive Psychology
   • Short-term memory limitations
   • Hick’s Law, Fitts’s Law, affordances

Example: why a button should look clickable, or why menus shouldn’t have 50 items

⸻

8. Design Patterns & Heuristics
   • Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics
   • Common UI patterns (modals, navbars, carousels, etc.)
   • Error prevention and clear feedback (e.g., “Your password is too weak”)

⸻

9. Real-World Project
   • You probably built and tested a UI/UX design project
   • Presented your process: research → design → test → improve
