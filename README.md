# 🧪 Coding Lab

Welcome to my personal coding lab — a living archive of all the code I write throughout my **computer science journey** at university and beyond.

This repo includes:

- 🎓 Coursework (assignments, labs, and projects from classes)
- 🤖 Personal experiments in Rust, Python, C, and more
- 🧠 Algorithm puzzles, string manipulation, math challenges, and logic games
- 🛠️ Systems programming, terminal setups, and Zed config hacks
- 🧰 Certification prep, side projects, and random curiosities I dive into

Everything here is a raw, real, and evolving record of me becoming a better developer.

> **Note:** This repo is intentionally messy, creative, and exploratory — it's my sandbox, not a polished portfolio (yet).
